# Welcome! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/N573qVR.gif" width="50px" height="50px">

Hi, I am Pitt Wu, a frontend engineer.

I have nearly 6 years of experience in frontend development and currently work remotely for a game company. My work focuses on implementing web-based information security features such as OTP, biometric authentication, and FaceID, as well as integrating real-time services using websocket. I am proficient in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and related frameworks and tools such as Vue and React.

As a frontend engineer, I believe that we are not only engineers but also creators. Therefore, I do not want to limit myself. In my spare time, I develop interesting projects using technologies such as Node.js and MongoDB to expand my knowledge of the entire software domain.
